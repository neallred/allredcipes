    name: 'Noquis',
    ingredients: '2 lbs. baking potatoes (about 6) \n 2 tbsp salt \n 2 eggs \n 1 cup fresh, good quality ricotta cheese \n 2-3 cups flour, plus more for dusting',
    instructions: '1. Peel and quarter the potatoes, putting them in a medium stock pot with enough water to cover the potatoes with one inch of water. \n 2. Add a scant handful of salt. \n 3. Put the potatoes to boil until they are tender when pierced with a fork , but not mushy. \n 4. Drain the potatoes. \n 5. Put the potatoes through a food mill or potato ricer. \n 6 In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, eggs, and ricotta, and mix well using your hands or a fork until a consistent dough is formed.  Be careful not to overmix. \n 7.  Add the flour a half cup at a time, mixing each time by hand until there is a soft, pliable dough.  The dough should not be sticky, and it should not be hard.  If it\'s too sticky or soft, the gnocchi will be mushy, but if there\'s too much flour, the gnocchi will be chewy and tough.  (This is the challenging part!). \n 8.  Knead the dough a few times until uniform, and divide the dough in half. \n 9. Flour a work area, and roll the dough out into a long thin roll about 3/4 inch thick. \n 10.  Cut these tubes of dough into sections about 1 inch long. \n 11.  Meanwhile, bring a stock pot of water to a boil. \n 12.  There are a variety of ways to \'mark\' the gnocchi-all just a style choice, since at this point, they are more or less done.  Here are some suggestions:  Mark an indentation in the center of each gnocchi with your index finger; or roll over the side of a cheese grater to make patterned indentations; or roll over the backside of a fork, or roll over the center of a wooden gnocchi tool. At this point, the gnocchi can be frozen laid out on a baking sheet lined with wax paper.  After they are frozen, they can be stored in a freezer bag.   Frozen gnocchi are just put into the boiling water like the unfrozen ones. \n 14. Throw the gnocchi one at a time into the boiling water. They are cooked when they rise to the top. \n 15. Collect with a slotted spoon and transfer to a plate. \n 16. Serve with the sauce of your choice.  (Some nice choices are walnut Gorgonzola, tomato or white sauce.)'
