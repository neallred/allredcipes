Recipe Box App
==============================
A Recipe Box built with Webpack, Babel, React, and Sass

Getting started
------------------------------
Install webpack: `npm install -g webpack`
Install the dev server: `npm install -g webpack-dev-server`
Install dependencies `npm install`

Server
------------------------------
`npm run server`

The go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

This will start up a webpack-dev-server that had hot module
replacement.  Just change a file and save and see the results
without having to refresh.



TODO
-----------
* Change reset recipe button to show a new page rather than overwriting data.
  * The other page will not have editing capability.
  * Could have multiple other pages for 'recipe boxes' of people.
* Add a filter to only view recipes containing what the user types in.
  * Have a checkmark box for multiple filters
