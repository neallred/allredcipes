Webpack - React + Redux starter
==============================
Simple starting point using React with redux.  Using webpack + babel 6+ 
as the build system. 

Getting started
------------------------------
Install webpack: `npm install -g webpack`
Install the dev server: `npm install -g webpack-dev-server`
Install dependencies `npm install`

Server
------------------------------
`npm run server`

The go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

This will start up a webpack-dev-server that had hot module
replacement.  Just change a file and save and see the results
without having to refresh.



TODO
-----------
* Axios for HTTP
* Less examples
* Unit testing
    * Enzyme
* Flow type?
