dumb component recipe display infor, do callbacks.

use arrow functions, you know its referencing sthe react component class

redner display the smart component, and recipe is dumb

callbacks
pass in function
when clicked, call this function

so recipedisplay as main smart.
that, or bubble it up to Apps
list as main, even though two more above
bubbling up two mor etimes, not a lot of benefit

just do pagination if it starts getting too big
